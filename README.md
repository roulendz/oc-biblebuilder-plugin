For me linking works as follwos.
I use bibles in following languages and link as follows
- Latvian Bible [LV] - BLV - **[[ Mat 1#v3 ]]** - Main translation with out translation Acronym
- New Latvian Translation [LV] - BJT - **[[ BJT Mat 1#v3 ]]** - Secondary translations with acronyms
- New King James Versoon [EN] - NKJV - **[[ NKJV Mat 1#v3 ]]**
- The Message Bibble [EN] - MSG - **[[ MSG Mat 1#v3 ]]**
- New Russian Translation [RU] - **[[ NRT Mat 1#v3 ]]**

You can also in settings define that you want to link Russian version like **[[ Мат 1#v3 ]]**
